1. HTML - (hypertext markup language): the one which helps to design a web page through some elements (Noun)
2. CSS - (cascading style sheet): the one which helps you to provide style for HTML elements on the web page (Adjective)
3. JavaScript: the one, which is the language, to provide interactivity for the HTML elements on the web page (Verb)

create a web page:
1. technlogies: (HTMl, CSS, JS)
2. editor: Notepad, Atom, Web Storm, Submlime Text, Visual Studio Code etc.

4. TypeScript
5. Angular

HTML:
langauge/technique to create web page design
every browser has an HTML engine, which interprets the HTML file, understands the tags and displays the design in the browser
HTML helps to create static web pages (where the content of the page does not chnage over time)
you use JS to add inter-activity for the web page, which makes the web page dynamic (it can response to the user interaction)

HTML uses pre-defined tags/elements to create the design

openning tag: <> 
closing tag: </>

example: <button></button>

attribute:
tags can have attribute (name-value pair)
example: id is an attribute with value "button1"
<button id="button1"> </button>

tags can have nested tags or direct values

a. tag having direct value:
<button id="button1">Click</button>

Click is the text of the button. the button tag here has no nested tags

b. nested tags:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Name</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

c. empty tags: tags which does not contain anything nested (tag or textual value)
< /> or <> (new style)
<meta charset="utf-8" /> or <meta charset="utf-8">

every HTML document can have two parts: 
a. head (information) and 
b. body (actual web page design)

Head:
	meta tag: information of web page, such as <meta charset="utf-8">


h tag: <h1> to <h6>

CSS:
style: set backgroynd color of the button
every browser understands the CSS file content and apply the CSS styles on the HTML tags/elements

css-property    : value
background-color: burlywood;

CSS-selector    attribute  css-property    : value
<button 	style =   "background-color:burlywood;">Click Me!!! </button>


event: action performed on an elemen tag. such as click event of button
as a result of an event, you want some code to be executed, which is written in javascript
the JS code is written using <script> tag in HTML file
the <script> tag can be written inside head or body or both

web servers:
	IIS ( Internet Information Services - Windows)
	Apache Tomcat

IIS web server path, where web applications should be present to be hosted by IIS (default path)
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\my-first-web-app

you can host the web app located in some other directory by creating a virtual directory under IIS and mapping the VD to the original location

formatting document:
VS code: Shift+Alt+F
VS: Ctrl+K+D



JavaScript: 
Scripting Language, Programming Language
Object-based programming language
Every browser has JS engine, which compiles and executes the JS code
example: 
chrome, edge, opera: these have V8 engine (written in C++). edge and opera are known as chrome kit browser
firefox: spidermonkey
safari: JS core

to access HTML document and its elements from/in JavaScript code file, every browser s/w (such as, chrome, edge, firefox, safari etc.) provides a library containing useful methods (getElementById, addEventListener), objects (document,window etc.) etc.
it is known Document Object Model (DOM)


JS:
//types of data:
	a. number
	b. bool
	c. string
	d. object

//variables:
	using 'var' keyword

JS is loosely-typed language
JS does not give you any compilation error, since there is no separate compiler for it
JS will throw rumtime error always, when the JS code is loaded into the browser and then interpreted
this is why JS is also known as dynamic programming language
JS can act like any programming language
IT is not only used as language for web apps, also used as language for non-web app, like desktop app

	
	undefined, null
//operators
//control flow statements


TypeScript: superset of JS, which helps you with data typing, compilation time checking etc.

It's like JS with compile time checking and nice data typification along with some extra feature

Node JS
