TS code -- (convert) --> JS code

1. if you running your web app with latest version of JS code in the older browser with older version of JS engine, the old JS engine might not understand the latest features of JS: convert new version of JS code into older version of JS code

2. also browser's JS engine, anyway, does not understand the TS code: convert TS code into JS code

s/w=> transpiler: to convert TS code into JS code or new version of JS code into older version of JS code

example: babel (new version of JS code into older version of JS code), typescript compiler [tsc - to convert TS code into JS code as well as to the older version of JS code]

typescript compiler was created using Node JS, the server side framework
install the TSC: use npm to install=> npm install typescript -g


when you install Node JS, the files are installed in C:\Program Files\nodejs folder
when you download and install third-party open-source s/w  like TypeScript compiler, babel compiler, @angualr/cli tool etc., they can be installed into a global folder: 
C:\Users\joydip\AppData\Roaming\npm
command: >npm in <s/w-name> -g


NPM is a s/w registry, where people can register the open source s/w s
NPM web site: npmjs.com
NPM CLI: npm includes a CLI (Command Line Client) that can be used to download and install software

NPM: Node Package Manager=> a downloader s/w (a command line interface/utiliy) to download and install the any other s/w created using Node JS mainly (also non-Node JS s/w s can be downloaded). NPM is installed automatically in your system when you install Node JS. 

other CLIs (command line interface) tools: yarn, bower etc. (install them first in your machine and then use them to download and install 3rd party open-source s/w )

package.json file
"npm init" --> command to create a package.json file and that file should be present at the root of the application directory


JSON=> JavaScript Object Notation. It is a format to represent your data. the format is very similar to JS object style

JS:
var anilObj = {
   name: 'anil',
   id:1,
   salary: 1000
}


information about a person in JSON format:
rules: 
data/value must be with a propery name, to describe the value
property name must be in double quotes, followed by a colon (:) and then value
types of values: string, number, boolean, object . string values must be in double quotes.

JSON object:
{
  "name":"anil",
  "id":1,
  "salary":1000
}
JSON array (of objects)
[
 {
  "name":"anil",
  "id":1,
  "salary":1000,
  "department":{
     "department-id":1,
     "department-name":"HR"
  },
  "projects":[
     "CITA", "SIS"
  ],
  "addresses":[
    { 
      "city":"bangalore",
      "pincode":560001,
      "type":"permanent"
    }, 
    {
      "city":"chennai",
      "pincode":56001,
      "type":"temporary"
    }
  ]
},
{
  "name":"sunil",
  "id":2,
  "salary":2000,
  "department":{
     "department-id":1,
     "department-name":"HR"
  },
  "projects":[
     "CITA", "SIS"
  ],
  "addresses":[
    { 
      "city":"mumbai",
      "pincode":560001,
      "type":"permanent"
    }, 
    {
      "city":"chennai",
      "pincode":56001,
      "type":"temporary"
    }
  ]
}
]

JSON array (of objects) stored as part of another object:
{
  "employees":[
 	{
  	"name":"anil",
  	"id":1,
  	"salary":1000,
  	"department":{
     		"department-id":1,
     		"department-name":"HR"
  	},
  	"projects":[
     		"CITA", "SIS"
  	],
 	 "addresses":[
    	{ 
     	 "city":"bangalore",
     	 "pincode":560001,
      	"type":"permanent"
    	}, 
    	{
     	 "city":"chennai",
      	"pincode":56001,
     	 "type":"temporary"
    	}
  	]
   },
  {
  "name":"sunil",
  "id":2,
  "salary":2000,
  "department":{
     "department-id":1,
     "department-name":"HR"
  },
  "projects":[
     "CITA", "SIS"
  ],
  "addresses":[
    { 
      "city":"mumbai",
      "pincode":560001,
      "type":"permanent"
    }, 
    {
      "city":"chennai",
      "pincode":56001,
      "type":"temporary"
    }
  ]
}
]
}

JSON format is used to configure
a. applicaion configuration 
b. compiler, toll configuration etc.

any NPM package (3rd party, open source s/w) that you want to install
a. install the package globally (any application can use the package) 
b. install the package locally (in an application you install the package, accessible only to that application)

TypeScript configuration:
if you want to configure the tsc compiler, 
a. create a file tsconfig.json at the root of your application directory
b. then write the settings in that file

web application development:
1. create a blank folder
2. add the package.json file at the root of your app directory [>npm init]
3. install necessary packages [mpm i package-name]
4. create tsconfig.json file at the root of your app directory and wrote the configuration settings for tsc

5. add the HTML page
6. create source codes using typescript and place thoe files in a source code folder inside the application directory

7. now run tsc
8. link the JS file created and stored in the output directory with the HTML file

when you install any package locally or globally, the package gets installed as part of node_modules folder. in that folder there is a .bin folder, where the script files for running those packages are present.

1. language: TypeScript (also JS)
2. transpiler: tsc
3. tool to create Agular app: Angular CLI tool (@angular/cli)


Before Angular:
1. design (HTML)
2. styles (css)
3. code (JS/TS)
4. DOM 
5. Node JS
6. NPM
7. packages and their install and scripts
8. JSON format
9. transpilation  and different tools: development server, transpiler and many more
10. web application development and SPA  and components

s/w: Node JS and NPM, angular cli tool, VS Code (editor) 

Angular: 
Building block: components
Component: code (*.ts) + style(*.css) + design (*.html)

Things in Angular:
Component, Directive, Pipe, Service etc.

everything that you create is a class

everything must have a decorator, which is a function

Component in Angular is a class
at the top of the class use a decorator function: @Component()

component:
@Component()
class SomeComponent{}

app-*-*-*

Pipe: 
@Pipe()
class SomePipe{}

Directive:
@Directive()
class SomeDirective{}
