authentication and authorization using asp.net core and angular front-end
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JSON Web Token: Jwt
----------------------------------------
Open, industry standard technique for security
carries claims between two parties
this means that, data sent between two parties using JWT is digitally signed and can be easily confirmed and trusted

xx.yy.zz

xx
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

this object is encoded in Base64Url format
yy
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
this object is encoded in Base64Url format

1. add nuget packages:
    a. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer (v3.1.23): ASP.NET Core middleware that enables an application to receive an OpenID Connect bearer token.
    b. System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt (v6.16.0): Includes types that provide support for creating, serializing and validating JSON Web Tokens.

2. add dependency for authentication service supporting Jwt authentication scheme in ConfigureServices method in StartUp.cs file
3. add middleware for authentication in Configure method in Startup.cs file

4. autheticate user, and if authenticated successfully, generate Jwt and send the same as response to the front-end
